Jul. 21 2013;Got up 5 times with Colton. I am proud to say that each time was for a diaper. He is not wasting our time crying wolf wolf. Simone and I may take him to the Mexican restaurant, Green Chillies sp? today. Will see how that goes. My first note asking for job opportunities is going out today. All in all I'm in a good place. I do want to pursue the transition support /value creation... But I want to spend time with Colton and Simone now. Vimbli will give that freedom to me in future but I need to solve  for near term cash flow. The development of Vimbli took much longer than expected and the actual timing does impact my decision space. I am looking at Colton now. He is sleeping peacefully. I do want to continue to provide him with a safe environment. ;How did you use your time today?;3;How well did you care of the people in your life today?;3;Have you created (and used!) opportunities to ask for help or support today?;3;How do you feel about today?;3;How do you feel about tomorrow?;2;Colton Strydom,Support Vimbli

I will send material to A16Z, mckinsey and gap on Monday. Also I hope to figure out fitbit on Monday. The meeting with kaiser yesterday made me feel good about the feedback.

I cannot help Simone if we don't have options to feed Colton.  We also need to resolve the pumping and the lipase taste in the   expressed milk.
