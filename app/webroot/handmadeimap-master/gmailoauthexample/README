Twitter oAuth Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Before using this example, you must add your own keys to config.php!*

*The final part of this process won't work until Google open up full API access!*

You can give this a try for yourself at http://web.mailana.com/labs/handmadeimap/gmailoauthexample/

This is an example showing how to handle the user authorization process for requesting
access to a Gmail account through OAuth and IMAP. It displays a simple UI, storing the needed
state in session variables. 
For a real app, you'll probably want to keep them in your database, but this arrangement
makes the example simpler.

To install this example, just copy all the files in this folder onto your web server,
edit config.php to add the oAuth tokens you've obtained from registering your domain with Google and then load the
index page in your browser.
To get the oAuth tokens, go to http://twitter.com/oauth_clients and register an
application.
