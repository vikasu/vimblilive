The research indicates companies focus too much on the company and not enough on the new hire.  Most of the messages in the first days and weeks are primarily about the company.  Read the <a title=\"The First Minutes Count - HBS Working Knowledge\" href=\"http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/7193.html?wknews=04032013\" target=\"_blank\">full article</a> in Working Knowledge for  details on how Wipro determined focusing on the individual resulted in more than 25 percent better retention than the traditional company-focused program.\r\n\r\n<em>The researchers are currently expanding the study.  If your company is interested in participating, please contact Francesca Gino directly at <a href=\"mailto:fgino@hbs.edu\">fgino@hbs.edu</a>.</em>\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n<em>If you liked the \"Minutes\" article and want to learn more about the latest research by Francesca check out her latest book <a title=\"Get Your Decisions to Stick - Get Sidetracked!\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Sidetracked-Decisions-Derailed-Stick-Plan/dp/1422142698\">Sidetracked</a>.  Sidetracked provides a framework to help you understand these influences, and provide tips and tricks on how you can get more of your decisions to stick!</em>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;','The First Minutes Count (Harvard Research)','','publish','open','open','','the-first-minutes-count-harvard-research','','','2013-04-08 02:26:25','2013-04-08 02:26:25','',0,'http://vimbli.com/beta/app/webroot/blog/?p=208',0,'post','',0),(39,1,'2012-12-06 11:57:21','2012-12-06 11:57:21','','iStock_000005449225Large1','','inherit','open','open','','istock_000005449225large1-2','','','2012-12-06 11:57:21','2012-12-06 11:57:21','',0,'http://75.125.190.162:7427/app/webroot/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/iStock_000005449225Large12.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(38,1,'2012-12-06 11:56:57','2012-12-06 11:56:57','','iStock_000005449225Large1','','inherit','open','open','','istock_000005449225large1','','','2012-12-06 11:56:57','2012-12-06 11:56:57','',0,'http://75.125.190.162:7427/app/webroot/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/iStock_000005449225Large11.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(21,1,'2012-12-05 17:43:37','2012-12-05 17:43:37','Getting the job is awesome!

Cathedral and/ or Tent ...[/caption]\r\n\r\nNo one transition looks the same, but successful transitions have common elements.  A successful transition requires a lot of effort and focus, but there are 5 common elements:\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><strong>Your VISION</strong> of what success looks like:  Are you building cathedral, building a shack or pitching a tent.  Your answer will impact everything you do.  If you don’t have an answer you’ll probably need to buckle up for a bumpy ride ‘til you find the vision, and find the sponsor who shares the vision with you.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Your PLAN</strong>, with building blocks:  Something worthwhile needs you to do a few things, and to do the things well.  What the things are often differ, but in most cases a transition requires building and maintaining relationships.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Your Execution: </strong> Plans are great, but in the case of your own life you have to go and execute your plan.  Many other things in life you can get others to do for you.  Your life you have to live yourself.  Having others with you makes the journey more fun, but you need to do the living.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Your R<span style=\"color: #000000;\">eflection</span>: </strong> Few plans actually work out as planned.  Hence the name, \"Plan\".  Reflecting on your progress (and where possible working with your sponsor and possibly some advisors and supporters) is critical.  Regular reflection allow you to identify what work and what does not.  In many ways that is what a journal done well achieves.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Your Adjustments: </strong>Many people reflect, and reflect but never take action on the reflection.  Reflection impacts your plan in 2 ways.  You can decide something is working, and do more of it OR you can decide something is not working and make a change.  The latter catergory also includes achieved goals.  Celebrate your achievements. Celebrate your failures.

Recruit a sponsor for your \"endeavour\", and share your view of success (Optional, but highly recommended)\r\n\r\n2.  Convert the \"success\" into the activities and relationships that will increase the probability of a successful outcome\r\n\r\n3.  Review progress and make adjustments throughout the transition (with your sponsor, as needed)\r\n\r\nThese 3 elements are deceptively simple on paper, but extremely difficult to execute in practice.  In order to make it as easy as possible we have developed a solution that automates most of the data capture and visualization.\r\n\r\nAt the core Vimbli integrates securely with your calendar, email and address book.  Currently we have Google (gmail and Google Apps) covered, we are working to add Microsoft Exchange.  In future we intend to add voice, IM and SMS as well.\r\n\r\nFor different roles Vimbli allows templates to give you a start to plan your our transition.  There is no short-cut on this piece you need to do the work to define what you want out the mission, what you will do to get it, and share the plan with your sponsor.\r\n\r\nCommunication with your sponsor is streamlined using personalized emails with your activity and goal information.  You own the update.  Before sharing it with your sponsor you have the opportunity to make edits to the content.  Yes you can add and delete.  What you share is your decision.\r\n\r\nWe have created Vimbli with you in mind.   The application will most likely live in the enterprise, but our intend is to serve individuals who want to live life to the full.\r\n\r\nThat is why we picked the name Vimbli.  A play on \"vim and vigor\", meaning \"a zest for life\".  We wanted to capture the energy involved in transitions and personal growth.  We are looking forward to have you on the journey with us.\r\n\r\nWhat would you like to see in a solution like Vimbli?  Let us know.','What is Vimbli?','','inherit','open','open','','1-revision-7','','','2013-03-29 15:39:07','2013-03-29 15:39:07','',1,'http://vimbli.com/beta/app/webroot/blog/1-revision-7/',0,'revision','',0),(184,1,'2013-03-29 16:14:36','2013-03-29 16:14:36','When you think about your vision make it personal.

If you have different tips for different transitions feel free to share.','Pursuing the value in transitions','','inherit','open','open','','80-revision-9','','','2013-02-18 23:28:18','2013-02-18 23:28:18','',80,'http://vimbli.com/beta/app/webroot/blog/?p=157',0,'revision','',0),(162,1,'2013-05-30 13:30:02','0000-00-00 00:00:00','To test if the addin works.  I hope so.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<div class=\"wysija-register\">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</div>\r\n&nbsp;','Wysija - Test','','draft','open','open','','','','','2013-05-30 13:30:02','2013-05-30 13:30:02','',0,'http://vimbli.com/beta/app/webroot/blog/?page_id=162',0,'page','',0),(163,1,'2013-03-04 19:18:18','2013-03-04 19:18:18','To test if the addin works.  I hope so.\n\n&nbsp;\n<div class=\"wysija-register\">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</div>\n&nbsp;','Wysija - Test','','inherit','open','open','','162-revision','','','2013-03-04 19:18:18','2013-03-04 19:18:18','',162,'http://vimbli.com/beta/app/webroot/blog/?p=163',0,'revision','',0),(292,1,'2013-05-28 19:09:15','2013-05-28 19:09:15','','Changing Onboarding Odds May 2013','','inherit','open','open','','vimbli-changing-onboarding-odds-survey-results-may-2013','','','2013-05-28 19:09:15','2013-05-28 19:09:15','',291,'http://vimbli.com/beta/app/webroot/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Vimbli-Changing-Onboarding-Odds-Survey-Results-May-2013.pdf',0,'attachment','application/pdf',0),(242,1,'2013-04-15 01:41:06','2013-04-15 01:41:06','[caption id=\"attachment_230\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"800\"]<img class=\" wp-image-230 \" title=\"Personal Goals - Survey\" src=\"http://vimbli.com/beta/app/webroot/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Personal-Goals.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"263\" /> From the Vimbli Survey: Words used to describe personal plans[/caption]\r\n\r\nWe will begin analyzing responses from the \"What Mattered Most\" onboarding <a title=\"New Job Success Survey\" href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/NewJobSuccess\" target=\"_blank\">survey</a> on April 15.\r\n\r\nYou have the opportunity to influence the report structure.

Below are the four.  Let me know what you do to make the most the time you spend waiting.\r\n\r\n<strong>1. Know why you are waiting ... </strong>\r\n\r\nThis sounds obvious, but in many cases waiting is an option.  Instead of waiting for the bus you can walk to the next bus stop, that cut back the wait time and add to your exercise time.  In some cases you are stuck with some waiting time.  If you are at the DMV it could be a long and frustrating wait ...\r\n\r\n<strong>2.  Get to know fellow \"waiters\" ...</strong>\r\n\r\nMost likely you are not waiting alone.  Take the time to get to know some of the people waiting with you.  This is the step I am most likely to skip, but I often find this to be the most rewarding use of my time.  Keep in mind s/he is just as frustrated by the wait as you, and if not it will be interesting to know why they are not annoyed by the wait.\r\n\r\n<strong>3.  Take action on things on your list ... </strong>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Your wait could be short, in which case you feel you cannot do anything productive.  Or it could be long, but you cannot work on that work sensitive material.  There could be several excuses not to take actions.  If you have a ready list of things you can do in various situations the excuses become less relevant, and it is easier to break free from inertia.</span>\r\n\r\nDon\'t know where to start?  A few ideas\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Less than 5 minutes?   Send a note to someone celebrating a birthday, send an invitation for coffee to a friend, jot down your thoughts related to a meeting later in the day, clean-up email subscriptions, ... </span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">30 minutes?  Draft a new document, review a proposal, clean-up your inbox, carry a couple of stamped postcards with you and send friends written notes, make phone calls ... </span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">More than an hour?  Mix-and-match the 30 minute elements, with shorter elements.   </span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 15.555556297302246px; line-height: 26.666667938232422px;\">Note the focus on creating and sharing.  Avoid \"consumption\" of content.  </span></div>\r\n<strong><span style=\"font-size: 15.555556297302246px; line-height: 26.666667938232422px;\">4.  Consume content, including people watching ... </span></strong>\r\n\r\nLastly, after I have exhausted my options in 1, 2 and 3 I\'ll switch to consumption of content.  People watching, reading, catching up on emails and LinkedIn, and if I really have time ... check Facebook.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">What do you do when you have to wait?</span>\r\n\r\nHennie\r\n\r\nFounder, Vimbli\r\n\r\nPhoto:  Courtesy <a title=\"Portugese Soldiers WW1\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/nlscotland/4699288263/\" target=\"_blank\">National Library of Scotland</a>, via Flickr.  <span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Original title: \'OFFICIAL PHOTOGRAPHS TAKEN ON THE BRITISH WESTERN FRONT.

You\'ll find things you like, and things you laugh at! and you\'ll probably have a good discussion with your partner on why you decided on your approach (and why you are/ were right!).\n\nThe summary of the \"research\" effort is:\n<ol>\n	<li>The change is personal.  You need to figure it out yourself.</li>\n	<li>Most agree on the following to do\'s  Create time for the mom, and be a true partner.   How you do it is up to you.</li>\n</ol>\nIn the written responses there are several gems. Here are a few:\n<ul>\n	<li>Accepting the fact that this is truly FOR LIFE!    Nothing that you have done will have as big an impact on your life.  Your kids remains your kids for the rest of your life...</li>\n	<li>It was all a blur. Got home with baby and thought: \"Now what!? Help!\".</li>\n	<li>No \"markers.\" it\'s a journey, not a destination.</li>\n	<li>One job at a time.  Keep yourself from thinking about the child in the aggregate - you\'ll go crazy.</li>\n	<li>...enjoy the ride, and always remember that the child isn\'t really yours...but rather us simply \"on loan\" from the Father above!</li>\n	<li>Kids spell love like this: TIME</li>\n	<li>Be sure to find time to focus on you as a couple. The kid(s) will move out but you will be together so you need to continuously invest in your relationship as a couple.</li>\n	<li>Enjoy the moment. It is fleeting. And don\'t panic! Babies are far more resilient than we give them credit for.</li>\n	<li>Being a father is the best job I have ever had.</li>\n</ul>\nDownload the cleaned-up responses <a title=\"Dad survey - June 2013\" href=\"http://vimbli.com/app/webroot/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Dad-plan-Survey-Results-June-23.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\n\n&nbsp;','Wisdom from Dads ... for dads ','','inherit','open','open','','400-autosave','','','2013-07-17 19:38:20','2013-07-17 19:38:20','',400,'http://vimbli.com/app/webroot/blog/400-autosave/',0,'revision','',0),(425,1,'2013-07-04 17:06:36','2013-07-04 17:06:36','<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-420\" title=\"Portugese soldiers - WW1\" src=\"http://vimbli.com/app/webroot/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Portugese-soldiers-WW1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"415\" />\n\nLife happens and sometimes we have to wait.  Either for something to happen, somebody to show up, or just for personal inspiration.\n\nI found that if I take an active approach to waiting the wait time is often very valuable, and in most cases enjoyable.  When I don\'t take an active approach.  Well, let\'s just say the outcomes are often sub-optimal.\n\nI developed a 4 step approach to make my waits more active, for the lack of a better term \"3 Keys of Active Waiting\".\n\n<strong>1.
